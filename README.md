# MCP 3202 HAL Driver
MCP3202 ADC module runs on SPI and this library helps you interface it with STM32 Microcontrollers using HAL Libraries. The library defaults to selecting channel one and continous conversion. The default values can be changed by editing the values of the control and start bytes according to the [datasheet.](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/21034F.pdf)
